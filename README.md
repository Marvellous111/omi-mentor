# Omi-Grok Mentor App

This project is a fastAPI application

## Project Type: FastAPI

---

We could use any other framework, but for speed and for parallel development we will use fastAPI

### IMPORTANT NOTE

---

We are relying on the example given to us with a lot of tweaks since it is a good entry point.
Further work on this app will slowly move away from the example to a more concrete work.
comments tagged with (from example) are gotten from example
comments tagged with (not example) are novel
comments tagged with (perhaps example) are edited example code

## FUTURE WORK

---

1. Chat Continuity: Talk to mentor in an isolated environment about problems based on the topic mentor gathers from your conversations in realtime.

2. Store mentor advice and conversation in a secure database to be used for context and future references where necessary.

## HOSTING SERVICE

---

Amazon ec2 or Render will be used for the hosting service.
